# Documentation for echo

## Tech used

- Next.js, because it's one of the fastest and most efficient ways to deploy SaaS applications quickly

- TailwindCSS, because it helps in creating responsive designs for applications and is highly customizable in comparison to frameworks like
  bootstrap

- We'll also use shadcn ui library to get modern components for the application so that we don't have to build them from scratch and waste time
  on that.

- I wanted to try a new technology like convex since it was essentially created by keeping tech founders' needs in mind. As a modern backend
  database has all the tools required to build and deploy fast

- I'll also be using clerk as a user management platform
